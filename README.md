# Manorrock Ocelot

_Note this project has gone into passive mode. See below for an explanation_

As a developer you have so many Cloud technologies that you have to use or
you  have to interact with but what you really want to do is to develop.

Manorrock Ocelot delivers you with the tools to make your cloud journey 
straightforward. With our tooling you will be able to quickly get up and running
so you can get back to developing your applications.

## What is passive mode?

A project can go into passive mode for either of two reasons. Either the project
is feature complete and no active development is needed. Or the project is no
longer considered a priority. Whatever the reason the end result is the same.

This means:

1. No more scheduled monthly releases.
2. If a bug is filed it is addressed on a best effort basis.
3. No new features are anticipated.
4. Releases are only cut on a needs basis and not more than once a month.
5. If you want your bug or feature to receive attention sponsoring is your best bet.
