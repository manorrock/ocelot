# Manorrock Ocelot

As a Java developer you have so many Cloud technologies that you have to use or
you  have to interact with but what you really want to do is to develop. 
Manorrock Ocelot delivers you with a CLI and/or a web application you can use
to cut through the noise and make cloud execution and/or deployment simple and 
lets you get back to developing your Java applications.
