# Manorrock Ocelot

As a developer you have so many Cloud technologies that you have to use or you 
have to interact with but what you really want to do is to develop. Manorrock 
Ocelot is a set of tools that allow you to cut through the noise and make cloud
execution and/or deployment simple and lets you get back to developing your
applications.
